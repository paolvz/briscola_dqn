# BRISCOLA

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the card game Briscola. The game is played between two players, one of which is the computer. The game is played with a deck of 40 cards, and the goal is to score more points than the opponent. The game is played in turns, and each turn consists of two phases: the first player plays a card, then the second player plays a card. The winner of the turn is the player who played the highest card, according to the following order: ace, three, king, queen, jack, seven, six, five, four, two.The game ends when all the cards have been played. The player with the highest score wins the game.

## How to run

Before running, install torch
> pip install torch torchvision torchaudio


then install rlcard:

> pip install .

### Train

Usually something like this:

> python3 ./examples/run_rl_finale.py --log_dir="experiments/briscola_dqn_final/"


### Play against Agent

Default play against dqn agent, change code if you want to play against a different checkpoint.

> python3 ./examples/human/briscola_human.py --opp_hand_visible="True"

### Test
To test different rewards in training phase substitute the files in `Different_Rewards` folder with those in `rlcard/env/Briscola` (game.py)  and `rlcard/utils` (utils.py). Finally, launch the command `pip install .`.

## Our code
this repo is  a fork of the official RLCards repo, we modified the following files:
- `examples/run_rl_finale.py`
- `rlcard/env/Briscola/briscola.py`
- `rlcard/env/Briscola` folder
- `rlcard/utils/utils.py`
- `rlcard/agents/dqn_agent.py`
- `rlcard/agents/human_agent.py` and `rlcard/agents/interfaccia.py`
-  `examples/human/briscola_human.py`

and other minor changes in other files.
